    <p>Healthy homemade protein bars. Very easy and quick. You know what goes in the recipe! My kids love them! Better than
    store-bought bars and great for after a work-out or as an anytime snack. Store in covered container in the refrigerator.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup old-fashioned oats</li>

        <li>½ cup flaxseed meal</li>
        <li>⅓ cup raisins</li>
        <li>⅓ cup dried cranberries</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vanilla whey protein powder</li>
        <li>½ cup white chocolate chips</li>
        <li>⅓ cup honey</li>
        <li>⅓ cup peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a 13x9-inch baking dish with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Mix oats, flaxseed meal, raisins, cranberries, and protein powder together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine chocolate chips, honey, and peanut butter together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave oven, stirring
        every 30 seconds, until the chocolate chips are nearly melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir oats mixture with the chocolate mixture until evenly mixed; spread into prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate bars until hardened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove bars from dish by lifting parchment; cut into squares using a
        pizza cutter.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>Add nuts, coconut, different dried fruits, swap out the white chocolate chips for chocolate chips, swap out the flavor
    of protein powder... the variations are never ending!</p>
